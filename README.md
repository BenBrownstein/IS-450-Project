# IS-450-Project
Project Management Project

Type: Software

The project will be a website that uses React. 

The site's contents will be multiple-choice questions that are on or similar to the test and questions on definitions of terms used in the test which will be selected from a drop-down list with multiple words that could be the correct answer. 

The site as a product will either be free with ads that for the prototype will be images that are different every time the site is loaded or the contents will be blocked until an access code is entered which shows the contents of the site. 

The access code would be a one-time purchase but is needed whenever the site is accessed.

The repo will show the changes that the project undergoes during development.
