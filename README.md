# IS-450-Project
Project Management Project
Type: Software
The project will be a website that uses React. 
The site's contents will be multiple-choice questions that are on or similar to the test and questions on definitions of terms used in the test which will be selected from a drop-down list with multiple words that could be the correct answer. 
The site as a product will either be free with ads that for the prototype will be images that are different every time the site is loaded or the contents will be blocked until an access code is entered which shows the contents of the site. 
The access code would be a one-time purchase but is needed whenever the site is accessed.
Time spent on the project will be tracked in an Excel sheet that is added and updated to the repo when it is being checked as it is more fluid.
The repo will show the changes that the project undergoes during development.
