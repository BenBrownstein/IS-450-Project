# IS-450-Project
Project Management Project

Type: Software

The project will be a website that uses React. 

The site's contents will be multiple-choice questions that are on or similar to the test and questions on definitions of terms used in the test which will be selected from a drop-down list with multiple words that could be the correct answer. 

The site as a product will either be free with ads that for the prototype will be images that are different every time the site is loaded or the contents will be blocked until an access code is entered which shows the contents of the site. 

The access code would be a one-time purchase but is needed whenever the site is accessed.

The repo will show the changes that the project undergoes during development.

Pictures needed for questions are stored in the public folder of React project


Todo

- Figure out how to switch to checkboxes for multi-answer questions
- Lock buttons after pressing either check answer or explanation
- Decide on how to score either remembering questions that are already answered or removing the previous question button
